# 🔒 Branch Protection Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will walk you through setting up comprehensive branch protection rules for the `main` branch to ensure code quality, security, and proper collaboration workflows.

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Navigate to Repository Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/DrJanDuffy/aliantehomesforsale.com
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Branches** in left sidebar
4. Click **Add rule** or **Add branch protection rule**

### 2. Configure Branch Protection

#### **Branch name pattern:**
```
main
```

#### **Protection Settings:**

##### ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
- [ ] Require pull request reviews before merging
- [ ] Required approving reviews: **1**
- [ ] Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
- [ ] Require review from code owners

##### ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
- [ ] Require status checks to pass before merging
- [ ] Require branches to be up to date before merging
- [ ] **Status checks that are required:**
  - `quality` (Code Quality job)
  - `build` (Build & Test job)
  - `performance` (Performance Testing job)
  - `security` (Security Scan job)

##### ✅ **Additional Protections**
- [ ] Require conversation resolution before merging
- [ ] Require signed commits (optional)
- [ ] Require linear history
- [ ] Require deployments to succeed before merging
- [ ] Lock branch
- [ ] Restrict pushes that create files that are larger than 100 MB

##### ✅ **Advanced Settings**
- [ ] Allow force pushes: **Leave unchecked**
- [ ] Allow deletions: **Leave unchecked**
- [ ] Include administrators: **Check this**

### 3. Save Configuration
Click **Create** or **Save changes**

## 🛡️ What Each Protection Provides

### **Pull Request Requirements**
- **Code Review**: All changes must be reviewed before merging
- **Quality Gates**: Automated checks must pass
- **Documentation**: Changes are tracked and documented

### **Status Check Requirements**
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline must succeed
- **Performance Validation**: Lighthouse CI must pass
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy security checks must pass
- **Build Verification**: Next.js build must complete successfully

### **Branch Locking**
- **Direct Push Prevention**: No one can push directly to main
- **Accident Prevention**: Protects against accidental changes
- **Audit Trail**: All changes go through proper channels

## 🔧 Required Status Checks

Based on your CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`):

| Job Name | Purpose | Required |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `quality` | Code quality, linting, type checking | ✅ Yes |
| `build` | Build verification, testing | ✅ Yes |
| `performance` | Lighthouse CI performance testing | ✅ Yes |
| `security` | Trivy security scanning | ✅ Yes |

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After setup, verify these protections are working:

- [ ] **Direct pushes to main are blocked**
- [ ] **Pull requests are required** for all changes
- [ ] **Code reviews are mandatory** before merging
- [ ] **CI/CD checks must pass** before merging
- [ ] **Status checks are enforced** on all PRs
- [ ] **Branch is locked** against accidental changes
- [ ] **Administrators are included** in protection rules

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### **Bypassing Protection (Emergency Only)**
1. Go to **Settings > Branches**
2. **Temporarily disable** the protection rule
3. Make necessary changes
4. **Re-enable** the protection rule
5. Document why bypass was needed

### **Force Push (If Absolutely Necessary)**
1. Disable branch protection temporarily
2. Use `git push --force-with-lease origin main`
3. Re-enable protection immediately
4. Document the incident

## 🎯 Expected Results

With branch protection enabled:

- **Code Quality**: All changes go through review and testing
- **Security**: No unauthorized changes to main branch
- **Collaboration**: Structured contribution process
- **Deployment**: Only tested and approved code reaches production
- **Professional Standards**: Enterprise-grade development workflow

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Status checks not showing up**
   - Ensure GitHub Actions are enabled
   - Check workflow file syntax
   - Verify job names match exactly

2. **Protection rules not applying**
   - Check branch name pattern
   - Verify rule is saved and active
   - Check if you have admin permissions

3. **CI/CD failures blocking merges**
   - Review workflow logs
   - Fix failing tests
   - Update dependencies if needed

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Review workflow configuration
3. Consult GitHub documentation
4. Contact repository administrators
